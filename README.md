This is a set of computational models associated with the paper "Fruit shape diversity in the Brassicaceae is generated by varying patterns of anisotropy", by
Eldridge et al, Development (2016) 143, 3394-3406 [10.1242/dev.135327](https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.135327).

The models are in the folders:

GPT\_Arabidopsis\_measurecells\_20160401  GPT\_Capsella\_All\_models\_20160824  GPT\_latiseptate2\_20140909

The models can be run using the Matlab package GFtbox, which is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/JIC-Enrico-Coen/GrowthToolbox). GFtbox requires an installation of Matlab, which is commercial software available from [Mathworks](https://Mathworks.com).
